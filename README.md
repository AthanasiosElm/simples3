#Simples3

##Overview
A fairly simple, decently quick interface to Amazon's S3 storage service.

It grew out of frustration with other libraries that were either written too
pragmatically (slow), too bloatedly, or just half-done.

The module aims for:

 * simplicity,
 * decent speed,
 * non-intrusiveness.

It really is designed to fit into programmer memory. The three basic operations
are as easy as with dictionaries.

##Dependencies

Requires **Python 2.5+** and **nose** for running tests. Python 3 support is not yet available. Apart from that, the code relies solely on Python
standard libraries.
